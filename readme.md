# Simple Character (Java game)
### What is it?
Simple Character is a simple concept 2D platformer game where you collect coins.
The game is written in Java and compiled as a gradle project.
### Libraries used
The graphics processing and game logic handling is done with the help of [Libgdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)
### Recommended IDE
[IntelliJ IDEA 2015](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) is recommended, as the project is set up as an IntelliJ folder structure project.
### Setup instructions (IntelliJ)
Assuming you've installed IntelliJ and pulled/downloaded the project:
1. Open the build.gradle file with IntelliJ
2. IntelliJ should resolve remote libraries automatically - give it a minute (status in the lower right)
3. Edit Run/Debug Configurations for the desktop module
4. Press the + and select Application
5. Name the configuration something like "Desktop"
6. Put com.patrickchristensen.simplecharacter.desktop.DesktopLauncher in "Main class"
7. Select the desktop module in the "Use classpath of module" setting
8. Apply and you should be good to go
